  {\Huge Performance Notes }
\end{center}

{\large Instrumentation}

\textit{Aristeia} is written for a solo percussionist playing three sets of three instruments.
Specific instrumentation is left up to the performer, within the following bounds:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All percussion is unpitched
  \item Each set of three instruments must be chosen from the same family, arranged in rough low to high order
  \item Each set of three must be from a different instrument family
  \item All instruments should be playable with the same beaters or mallets
  \item The sustain and decay for all instruments should be fairly quick
\end{itemize}

{\bf For example}, one possible instrumentation would be three wood blocks, three toms, and three table cymbals

{\large Grace Notes}

Grace notes are always played before the beat, including grace notes that precede a rest.


{\large Dynamics}

Dynamics in \textit{Aristeia} are notated in a range from \lilyDynamics{pp} to \lilyDynamics{ff}. These should be taken to define the desired sharpness of attack, rather than the resultant sound.
